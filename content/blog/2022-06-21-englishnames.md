## Introduction

There are twenty-four other children in Tommy's class. Twelve are boys and twelve are girls.

Every morning, at school, Mrs. Zimmerman, the teacher, calles out the names of the children. The children shout "present" after they hear their names.

## Family Names

Your last name is your family name. Your first name is your given name. It's called "given name" because your parents give it to you.

Your family name has probably been in your family for hundreds of years.

### History

At one time many years ago, people had only one name, a given name.

People lived in small villages wehre everyone knew each other. Over the years, the population increased. In the towns and villages many people had the same name, and it started to get confusing.

In one village there may have been eight men called John. The villagers had to add words to the different Johns' names to understand which John they were talking about.

Some of the Johns were known by adding their father's name. For example, John, David's son, or John, Jack's son.

Others were known by where they lived. For example, John from the hill, or John from the lake.

Others were known by the job they did. For example, John the carpenter or John the gardener.

Still others were known by some personal feature. For example, John the short, or John with white hair.

Since the Middle Ages, the rulers of many countries wanted to know who everyone was in their country, so they can collect taxes without any mistakes. Laws were passed that said everyone had to have a last name.

In our example village, John, David's son became John _Davidson_. John, Jack's sone became John _Jackson_. John from the lake became John _Lake_, John from the hill became John _Hill_. John the carpenter become John _Carpenter_, and John the gardener became John _Gardener_. John the short became John _Short_. John with white hair became John _White_.

Our last names are usually based on one of the four groups:

1. father's name
2. place where they lived
3. job or trade
4. person's appearance

Let's look at all the children in Tommy's class and divide their names into the four groups.

### Names from a Father

- _Fitz_ means "son of" and came from France. _Fitzgerald_ meant "sone of Gerald"
- _Johnsone_ started off as "John's son", and _Jackson_ as "Jack's son"
- _Mac_ and _Mc_ mean "son of" and occur in Scottish and Irish names. _Macdonald_ meant "son of Donald"
- _O'_ means "son of" and is used in Irish names. "O'Brian" meant "son of Brian"
- _kins_ at the end of a name formed a nickname meaning "little". _Tomkins_ meant "little Tom", or "Tom's little one"
- _ez_ at the end of a name meant "son of" in Spanish. _Rodriguez_ meant "son of Roderick"

**Common Names from Father's First Name**

| Son of  | Last Name                          |

| Evan    | Evans<br>Bevan<br>Evanson          |

### Names from a Place

- _Figueroa_ means "where the fig trees grow" in Spanish. So Robert Figueroa's ancestors came from a place where fig trees grew in Spain.
- _Garcia_ is the name of a place in Spain, so Jose's ancestors came from this town.
- _Yamamura_ is Japanese. _Yama_ means "mountian" and _mura_ means "village". David's ancestors came from a village in the mountains of Japan.

**Common Names from Places**

| Place                             | Last Name |
| :-------------------------------- | :-------- |

### Names from a Job

The ancestors of the children in the class with "job" names were bakers, clerks, fishermen, gardeners, goldsmiths, and tailors.

- _Schumacher_ menas "shoemaker" in German, so Brittany had an ancestor who made shoes.
- Jason Freeman's ancestors were salves. They were captured in Africa and brought, against their will, to America to work in the fields. When slavery was abolished, they were able to choose their own names. Many picked the names of their former masters. Some, like Jason's ancestors, chose the name _Freeman_.

**Jobs No Longer Exist but Names Live on**

| Potter    | made pots              |

### Names from a Description

- The first ancestor of Daniel _Armstrong_ with a last name was known as a strong man.
- Chan is Chinese and means "old", so the first person to have a last name in Kim's family was old.
- Joshua _Fox_'s ancestor was probably cunning, like a fox.

**Common Names from Description**

### Categories

Now we can group children's last names and put them into four categories.

| Father                                                                           | Place                                          | Job                                                                                   | Description                                     |

## Changing Names

Sometimes family names were changed for different reasons. Many of the people going to America from Europe had difficult names to pronounce and spell. To make things less difficult, they changed their names.

Sometimes, people arrived in the country and an official would change their name for them. This was because the official couldn't understand them when he asked them their names, or he couldn't spell it properly.

- Someone called _Jan Micsza_ would have become _John Mcshea_.
- Someone with the last name of _Mlynar_ would become _Miller_.
- _Hildergart Zimmerman_, German for "carpenter", would become _Hilda Carpenter_.

Sometimes actors and singer change their names so that people will remember them more easily, like _Babyface_ from Kenneth Brian Edmonds, _Tom Cruise_ from Thomas Cruise Mapother IV, _Eminem_ from Marshall mathers III, _Elton John_ from Reginald Kenneth Dwight, _Madonna_ from Madonna Louise Ciccone, _Sting_ from Gordon Matthew Sumner, _Tiger Woods_ from Eldrick Woods.

## First Names

Now let's look at given names or first names.

### Meaningful Names

Most first names have meanings, which are very old and now forgotten.

**Meanings of Some Common First Names**

| Name      | Meaning              | Language    |
| :-------- | :------------------- | :---------- |
| Ashley    | from the ash tree    | Old English |
| Brittany  | a woman from Britain | Irish       |
| Stephanie | crown                | Greek       |
| Amanda    | lovable              | Latin       |
| Michael   | Who is like God      | Hebrew      |
| Andrew    | courageous           | Greek       |
| Robert    | bright fame          | English     |
| David     | friend               | Hebrew      |

### Family Names as First Names

In the past few years, it has become popular to use family names as first names. Some examples:

- Tyler, originally a family name from someone who put tiles on roofs
- Hunter, a hunter
- Logan, Irish, from a cove
- Mason, a stone mason
- Blake, Old English, white
- Tanner, English, leather-worker
- Morgan, Welsh, sea dweller
- Haley, English, hay meadow
- Brooke, lived near a brook

## Nicknames

Very often, first names are shortened or changed. These names are called nicknames. Let's look at Tommy's class and see how many nicknames there are.

[^1]: Jason is called _Flash_, but that's not because of his name, but because he runs fast.
[^2]: Ashley is called _Spud_ because she eats a lot of potatoes.

## Epilogue

假使有人问你，玛格丽特·撒切尔夫人（ _Ms. Margaret Thatcher_）的夫婿祖上是从事什么职业，你能猜到么？

如果你知道英文名的由来，那大概就能猜个八九不离十，因为 thatch 是茅草屋顶的意思，而 thatcher 是指修屋顶的工匠，原来他们老家是修屋顶的手艺人！
