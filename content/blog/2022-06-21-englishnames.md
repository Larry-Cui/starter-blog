["Reading A-Z for Kids"](https://www.raz-kids.com/) 是套非常优秀的英语阅读教材。我随着监督孩子学习，自己也涨了不少见识，这里就通过 S 级的第一本书，介绍一下英文名字的由来。

<!-- excerpt -->

为了书写方便，以下我就都用英文了，反正能读到这篇文章的小伙伴们，这点英文不成问题。

## Introduction

There are twenty-four other children in Tommy's class. Twelve are boys and twelve are girls.

Every morning, at school, Mrs. Zimmerman, the teacher, calles out the names of the children. The children shout "present" after they hear their names.

## Family Names

Your last name is your family name. Your first name is your given name. It's called "given name" because your parents give it to you.

Your family name has probably been in your family for hundreds of years.

### History

At one time many years ago, people had only one name, a given name.

People lived in small villages wehre everyone knew each other. Over the years, the population increased. In the towns and villages many people had the same name, and it started to get confusing.

In one village there may have been eight men called John. The villagers had to add words to the different Johns' names to understand which John they were talking about.

Some of the Johns were known by adding their father's name. For example, John, David's son, or John, Jack's son.

Others were known by where they lived. For example, John from the hill, or John from the lake.

Others were known by the job they did. For example, John the carpenter or John the gardener.

Still others were known by some personal feature. For example, John the short, or John with white hair.

Since the Middle Ages, the rulers of many countries wanted to know who everyone was in their country, so they can collect taxes without any mistakes. Laws were passed that said everyone had to have a last name.

In our example village, John, David's son became John _Davidson_. John, Jack's sone became John _Jackson_. John from the lake became John _Lake_, John from the hill became John _Hill_. John the carpenter become John _Carpenter_, and John the gardener became John _Gardener_. John the short became John _Short_. John with white hair became John _White_.

Our last names are usually based on one of the four groups:

1. father's name
2. place where they lived
3. job or trade
4. person's appearance

Let's look at all the children in Tommy's class and divide their names into the four groups.

### Names from a Father

- _Fitz_ means "son of" and came from France. _Fitzgerald_ meant "sone of Gerald"
- _Johnsone_ started off as "John's son", and _Jackson_ as "Jack's son"
- _Mac_ and _Mc_ mean "son of" and occur in Scottish and Irish names. _Macdonald_ meant "son of Donald"
- _O'_ means "son of" and is used in Irish names. "O'Brian" meant "son of Brian"
- _kins_ at the end of a name formed a nickname meaning "little". _Tomkins_ meant "little Tom", or "Tom's little one"
- _ez_ at the end of a name meant "son of" in Spanish. _Rodriguez_ meant "son of Roderick"

**Common Names from Father's First Name**

| Son of  | Last Name                          |
| :------ | :--------------------------------- |
| William | Williams<br>Williamson             |
| Will    | Wilkins<br>Wilson                  |
| Watt    | Watson<br>Watkins                  |

| Evan    | Evans<br>Bevan<br>Evanson          |

### Names from a Place

- _Figueroa_ means "where the fig trees grow" in Spanish. So Robert Figueroa's ancestors came from a place where fig trees grew in Spain.
- _Garcia_ is the name of a place in Spain, so Jose's ancestors came from this town.
- _Yamamura_ is Japanese. _Yama_ means "mountian" and _mura_ means "village". David's ancestors came from a village in the mountains of Japan.

**Common Names from Places**

| Place                             | Last Name |
| :-------------------------------- | :-------- |
| from a moor                       | Moore     |

### Names from a Job

The ancestors of the children in the class with "job" names were bakers, clerks, fishermen, gardeners, goldsmiths, and tailors.

- _Schumacher_ menas "shoemaker" in German, so Brittany had an ancestor who made shoes.
- Jason Freeman's ancestors were salves. They were captured in Africa and brought, against their will, to America to work in the fields. When slavery was abolished, they were able to choose their own names. Many picked the names of their former masters. Some, like Jason's ancestors, chose the name _Freeman_.

**Jobs No Longer Exist but Names Live on**

| Name              | Job Description                                            |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cooper            | A cooper made wooden barrels                               |
| Hooper            | A hooper made hoops for barrels                            |
| Archer and Bowman | Archers and bowman were soldiers who used a bow and arrows |
| Fletcher          | A fletcher made arrows                                     |
| Carter            | A carter made or drove carts                               |
| Wheeler           | A Wheeler made wheels for the carts                        |
| Tanner            | A tanner worked with leather                               |

假使有人问你，玛格丽特·撒切尔夫人（ _Ms. Margaret Thatcher_）的夫婿祖上是从事什么职业，你能猜到么？

如果你知道英文名的由来，那大概就能猜个八九不离十，因为 thatch 是茅草屋顶的意思，而 thatcher 是指修屋顶的工匠，原来他们老家是修屋顶的手艺人！
